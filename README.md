# Patchstorage LV2 Uploader
Proof of concept utility for uploading LV2 plugins to Patchstorage.com - [https://patchstorage.com/platform/lv2-rpi-arm32/](https://patchstorage.com/platform/lv2-rpi-arm32/)

# IMPORTANT
- Currently, the LV2 section on Patchstorage is dedicated to 32-bit plugins compiled for Raspberry Pi 3/4! Let us know if you would like to see support for additional targets.
- Before uploading a plugin, ensure it wasnâ€™t uploaded by anyone else! If the uploaded version is outdated, please contact the original uploader on Patchstorage.
- At the moment, there is no support for bundles, only one plugin per single Patchstorage entry is allowed.

# Help Wanted
We are looking for any help with community-based efforts regarding `mod-ui` and `mod-host` projects - compiling, uploading, and maintaining plugins on Patchstorage, helping out with plugin build and contribution guides, and community support aspects on [Patchstorage](https://patchstorage.com/platform/lv2-rpi-arm32/) and [Unofficial MOD Community Discord](https://discord.gg/YyRNPVG6ZS). Reach out to us if you would like to help!

# Installation
- Python 3.7+
- `pip install requests click`

# Usage
Here are the steps to upload plugins from your Raspberry Pi running the `mod-ui` software:

1. Clone this repository on your computer.
1. Connect your Raspberry Pi to the same network as your computer. Make sure you can access the `mod-ui` page from your computer's internet browser.
1. Use FTP to connect to your Raspberry Pi and download plugins that you want to upload to Patchstorage and move them to the `/plugins` directory. All plugins should be in their corresponding folders, e.g. `/patchstorage-lv2-uploader/plugins/mod-bigmuff.lv2/`
1. Run `python ./uploader.py dump --url <http://raspberry_mod_ui_url>` - this command will create a `data.json` file using the `mod-ui` API inside the `/patchstorage-lv2-uploader` folder with plugin information.
1. Run `python ./uploader.py generate` - this command will generate `*.tar.gz` and `patchstorage.json` files in the `/builds` directory. Some information may be missing, so you will have to modify `licenses.json` or `sources.json` files.
1. Check the `/builds` folder for the results, especially the `patchstorage.json` files. Make adjustments if needed.
1. Run `python ./uploader publish --username <patchstorage_username>` command and follow the instructions. After uploading a plugin, please check the resulting entry on Patchstorage.

# TODO
- Use lilv lib (?) for extracting plugin information directly from *.ttl files.
- Validate *.tar.gz file contents before uploading
- Interactive patchstorage.json missing fields prompt on publish
